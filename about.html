                Hi. My name is Kendrick. I am a young composer/arranger. I like to upload my scores to different
                platforms for people to hear, buy, and hopefully perform at different events. I compose/arrange mostly
                Marching Band,
                Wind Ensemble - Beginning Band, and Full Orchestrations that range from The Box by Roddy Ricch to The
                Batman Theme orchestration and even personal projects that I work on throughout the year. My main goal
                is to expand my portfolio to hopefully one day be a composer of a major movie or TV Show. Every project
                that I do starts with me building up the main theme and going off of that. I try to make my music as
                unique as I possibly can so when you hear my music you know it's from me and me only.
            </p>

            <h1 class="title">Why</h1>
            <p class="info">
                One question I get a lot is why? Why do I do this? I do this because
                music can be the answer to a lot of problems going on in people's lives.
                I release arrangements that can be heard without purchasing and always available to listen to at any
                time/anywhere. Music is what my life revolves around. Not only do I
                write/arrange music. I also make beats, play two main instruments, and have been around music all my
                life, so I know what people want to hear. Music is also a great stress reliever so if I can help someone
                I will try anyway I can!
            </p>
